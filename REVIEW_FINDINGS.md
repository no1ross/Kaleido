# Kaleido Pre-Release Architecture & Code Review
## Consolidated Findings & Tracking Document

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date Created:** September 25, 2026 (v1) — **Merged/Updated:** September 25, 2026 (v2)  
**Review Scope:** Kaleido pre-1.0 release preparation  
**Status:** DRAFT — Ready for Team Review  

**v2.0 Note:** This revision merges a second, code-level analysis pass (per `docs/PRERELEASE_PROMPT.md`, phases 0–15) with the original v1 findings. Every v1 finding was re-validated against the actual source; several were corrected or superseded (see [Prior Findings — v1 Validation](#prior-findings-v1-validation)). New findings are numbered continuing the original ID scheme (CR-004+, HP-005+, MP-005+, LP-004+).

## Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment

Kaleido demonstrates **strong architectural discipline**: correct project layering, clean DI boundaries, disciplined exception taxonomy, and modern C# throughout. The second-pass review found the *code* healthier than the *documentation*: the most severe problems are stale docs describing a removed project, published-contract behaviors with zero test coverage, and production-unsafe defaults that are only surfaced via one-time log warnings.

| Dimension | v1 | v2 | Status |
|-----------|----|----|--------|
| Architecture | 8/10 | 8/10 | **Strong** — verified layering is correct; two real boundary leaks found |
| Simplicity | — | 6/10 | Registries/metadata pipeline heavier than needed |
| Developer Experience | 7/10 | 5/10 | Quickstart sample does not compile; magic defaults surprise |
| API Design | — | 6/10 | Public surface mostly honest; several leaks/typos/fragile conventions |
| Maintainability | — | 6/10 | Largest duplication blocks identified; brittle test suites resist change |
| Test Quality | 7/10 | 4/10 | Published contracts (error mapping, correlation echo, cancellation) untested |
| Observability | — | 7/10 | Well-instrumented; a documented invariant is violated |
| Documentation | 8/10 | 4/10 | Root docs describe a deleted project; several documented APIs don't exist |
| Release Readiness | 6/10 | 5/10 | Docs + test-contract gaps are release blockers |

### Key Observations

**Strengths:**
- Verified-clean layering: core is transport-free; `Kaleido.Http` is thin; no circular deps
- Security posture is good: no secrets, no unsafe deserialization, parameterized EF Core only, header sanitization applied consistently
- Exception taxonomy (`Kaleido*Exception` + typed error codes) is disciplined; no raw `InvalidOperationException` in `src/`
- Modern C# throughout: primary constructors, file-scoped namespaces, sealed records, collection expressions

**Concerns:**
- Root `README.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` describe `Kaleido.AspNetCore`, a project that no longer exists — the quickstart does not compile (CR-004)
- Published HTTP contracts (exception→status mapping, correlation echo, cancellation signaling) have ~zero test coverage (CR-005–007)
- Two production-critical seams default to loss modes (events discarded; unbounded in-memory state) with only a one-time warning (HP-009)
- A malformed correlation header produces HTTP 500 instead of 400 (HP-007)
- The documented "one cancellation signal" invariant is violated in `ProcessRuntime` (CR-007)

### Recommendation

**Kaleido is ~75% ready for 1.0.** The v1 estimate of 85% was optimistic — it assumed docs matched code. Realistic path: fix docs + contract tests + status-code mapping (Week 1–2), then targeted API cleanups while breaking changes are still free (Week 2–3).

---

## Prior Findings — v1 Validation

Each v1 finding was re-checked against source. Statuses: **CONFIRMED**, **PARTIALLY INCORRECT**, **SUPERSEDED** (folded into a new finding), **OPEN**.

### [CR-001] HTTP Abstractions layering — **OPEN, SHARPENED**

v1 asked whether `Kaleido.Http.Abstractions` mixes transport-agnostic and HTTP-specific types. Verified facts:
- The contracts in `Http.Abstractions` genuinely reference core runtime types — they are shared HTTP wire contracts, and `Kaleido.Http.Abstractions → Kaleido` is correct per `src/AGENTS.md`.
- Three concrete boundary leaks were found (new findings): `ProcessResponseFactory` is server-side projection logic sitting in the contract assembly (MP-013); `KaleidoHttpTelemetry` forces the OTel provider to depend on the HTTP contract package (LP-010); `KaleidoClientOptions`/`KaleidoClientEntry` are HTTP client config living in transport-agnostic `Kaleido` core (HP-012).
- `src/AGENTS.md` already states the multi-transport rule: each transport gets its own project (`Kaleido.Grpc`, etc.) with its own header constants. So "multi-transport" is the documented intent; the Option-A split is unnecessary if these leaks are plugged.

**Updated recommendation:** De-scope CR-001 from "split the project" to "fix the three boundary leaks" (HP-012, MP-013, LP-010). Keep Q-001 open as a product question but it no longer blocks release.

### [CR-002] Build hardening — **PARTIALLY INCORRECT**

v1's checklist was wrong on several items. Verified state (`src/Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.props`, `.gitignore`, `global.json`):
- ✅ Deterministic builds ON (`Directory.Build.props:7`)
- ✅ `GenerateDocumentationFile`, Source Link, `.snupkg`, symbol generation, license/repo metadata all present (`src/Directory.Build.props:7–23`)
- ✅ `TreatWarningsAsErrors` + `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` set — **but only in `src/`**, not `tests/` or `tools/` (MP-024)
- ❌ No `packages.lock.json`, no `--locked-mode` restore in CI (`build.yml`) (MP-024)
- ❌ No `dotnet pack` step or release pipeline despite `IsPackable=true` (MP-024)
- ❌ No coverage gate — CI collects and uploads coverage but enforces nothing (MP-024)
- ❌ `Version`/`PackageVersion` hard-coded `1.0.0` in `src/Directory.Build.props:5-6` — no prerelease versioning strategy (folded into CR-003)

### [CR-003] Versioning & release strategy — **CONFIRMED, SHARPENED**

All six packages hard-code `1.0.0`; no GitVersion/NBGV, no CI-driven versioning. Every build produces identical `1.0.0` nupkgs — prereleases cannot be distinguished or side-by-side published. Recommendation unchanged (RELEASE.md + NBGV or CI-driven `-p:PackageVersion`), now backed by concrete evidence.

### [HP-001] Extension points lack use cases — **CONFIRMED, EXPANDED**

The extension-point audit (Phase 10) verified most seams are earned: `IProcessContextStore`, `IEventPublisher`, `IKaleidoCorrelationContextAccessor/Initializer`, `IQueryContextSource*`, `IQueryViewSource*`, `IDelegateQueryViewSource*`, `KaleidoServiceOptions.Assemblies/TypeFilter` all have clear consumers. The genuinely questionable surface is narrower: public implementations that should be internal (`EventPublisher`, `ValueConverter`, possibly `DataTypeMapper`/`ConstraintMapper` — MP-016), public registry interfaces exposed only because `Map*` resolves them cross-assembly (MP-016), and `IProcessResponseFactory` public "for test mocking" (MP-013). The documentation gap remains real (HP-001 stands).

### [HP-002] Queryable dispatch underdocumented — **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**

`src/AGENTS.md` now documents the dispatch order as "fixed… published framework semantics" (delegated → local → direct). What remains: the precedence has **no test** (MP-019/TQ-06 — no test registers both a delegated and local view for the same type), and consumer-facing rationale/fallback docs are still absent.

### [HP-003] Analyzer rationale sparse — **CONFIRMED, EXPANDED**

Verified additional doc gaps: `KAL1010` (FixtureEmpty) and `KAL1011` (duplicate ExceptionRecord) exist in `DiagnosticIds.cs` but `docs/ANALYZERS.md` documents only KAL1001–1009. `tools/analyzers/` has no AGENTS/README at all; `tests/AGENTS.md` omits 4 of 9 test projects (MP-023).

### [HP-004] HTTP↔Runtime mapping scattered — **SUPERSEDED**

v1 described `Kaleido.AspNetCore/` containing `QueryableValueNormalizer`/`ProcessExecutionService` — that project no longer exists; these live in `src/Kaleido.Http`. The real mapping concerns found in v2: `GuardQueryAsync` duplicates `ExceptionMiddleware` (MP-007), `ProcessResponseFactory` sits in the wrong assembly (MP-013), `FieldLookup` is triplicated across a project boundary (MP-020), and `WriteResponseHeaders` duplicates the middleware's correlation echo (LP-009). Folded into those findings.

### MP-001..MP-004, LP-001..LP-003 — **UNCHANGED** (still valid as written)

MP-002 caveat: SQLite store coverage is thinner than feared — see MP-021. LP-002 partially addressed by HP-020 (validation bugs found in `ValidatePage`).

## Critical Findings

### [CR-004] Root documentation describes a removed project; quickstart does not compile

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Documentation / Consumer experience
- **Description:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 7–14, 40–50, 104, 117, 126, 216) lists `Kaleido.AspNetCore` as a current project with APIs (`AddAspNetCore()`, `AddQueryableAspNetCore`, `AddProcessorAspNetCore`, `UseKaleidoExceptionHandling()`); `README.md:188` uses `.AddAspNetCore()` in the Getting-Started sample and `README.md:341` links `src/Kaleido.AspNetCore/README.md`. The directory contains only stale `bin/obj` output — no csproj, no source. The real API is `AddHttp()` (`src/Kaleido.Http/KaleidoHttpServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:16`). Companion staleness: `src/Kaleido/README.md` documents `AddAssembly()`/`AddQueryable()`/`AddProcessor()` as public APIs (all internal/auto-invoked); `src/ARCHITECTURE.md` dependency graph shows `Kaleido.Http → Kaleido.AspNetCore → Kaleido`; `src/Kaleido.Http/README.md:65-70` shows an obsolete registration chain; `src/Kaleido.Provider.SQLite/README.md` includes a non-compiling sample; `src/Core/` likewise holds only bin/obj leftovers.
- **Why It Matters:** The first copy-paste a consumer tries does not compile; the architecture doc — the stated entry point — teaches wrong dependency rules.
- **Recommended Fix:** Regenerate project lists, dependency graph, and all bootstrap samples from the actual csproj graph and `AddKaleido(config, o => { o.ServiceName; o.Assemblies })` + `AddHttp()` + `Map*` model. Delete `src/Core/` and `src/Kaleido.AspNetCore/` stale directories.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** No — docs only (+ deletion of artifact dirs)
- **Migration Impact:** None
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Trustworthy entry-point docs; accurate boundary model
- **Can Be Automated:** Partially (csproj graph → docs script; snippet-compile CI check)

---

### [CR-005] ExceptionMiddleware exception→response contract is almost untested

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Testing — missing public-contract tests
- **Description:** `tests/Kaleido.Http.UnitTests/ExceptionMiddlewareTests.cs` (78 lines) has 2 tests: pass-through and `ArgumentException` → 400. There are no tests for `KaleidoValidationException` → 400 with `Code`+`Message`, `KaleidoConfigurationException`/`KaleidoFrameworkException` → 500 (Code log-only), unknown → 500, `BadHttpRequestException`, OCE handling, or response-already-started. Only one functional test asserts a 400 end-to-end; none exercise a 500 JSON body. Per `AGENTS.md`, the status/`Code`/`Message` contract is published behavior.
- **Why It Matters:** A regression leaking a log-only `Code` or flipping a status ships silently — including the HP-007 bug already in the code.
- **Recommended Fix:** Theory-driven matrix exception type → status + deserialized `KaleidoErrorResponse` assertion; one functional 500-shape test.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** No
- **Migration Impact:** None
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Locks the published error contract
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

---

### [CR-006] ObservabilityMiddleware correlation read/populate/echo is untested

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Testing — missing critical-path tests
- **Description:** `ObservabilityMiddlewareTests.cs` has a single test ("does not throw when initializer not registered"). The middleware's published duties — inbound header read, `IKaleidoCorrelationContextAccessor` population, `Activity` tagging, response echo — have zero tests, and no functional test asserts `X-Kaleido-*` response headers.
- **Why It Matters:** Correlation propagation is the framework's primary observability contract; a regression (lost echo, wrong header) surfaces only as production tracing gaps.
- **Recommended Fix:** Unit tests for context population + echo + Activity tags; one functional test asserting response headers.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** No
- **Migration Impact:** None
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Guards the distributed-tracing contract end-to-end
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

---

### [CR-007] Documented "one cancellation signal" invariant is violated — and unguarded by tests

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Observability — convention violation + missing tests
- **Description:** `src/Kaleido/Process/ProcessRuntime.cs:246-250` has `catch (OperationCanceledException) { observation.Canceled(); throw; }` at execution level while `ProcessExecutor.cs:174-176` already calls `stepObservation.Canceled()` — the documented single recording point. `AGENTS.md` explicitly forbids `Canceled()` at `ProcessRuntime`/`ProcessStepInvoker`. One disconnect ⇒ two cancellation signals + two Warning logs. Additionally no test anywhere asserts the invariant: `ProcessStepInvokerTests`' mock observability has a no-op `HandlerFailed`; `ExecutionProcessorTests` never asserts `Canceled()` once / `*Failed` never; `ProcessRuntimeTests`/`QueryContextEngineTests` have no OCE tests. Note `eventPublisher.PublishAsync(..., cancellationToken)` at `ProcessRuntime.cs:235-240` can itself throw OCE on an already-canceled token.
- **Why It Matters:** Directly contradicts a published invariant; inflates cancellation metrics and triggers false alerts; nothing prevents recurrence.
- **Recommended Fix:** Remove the `Canceled()` call in `ProcessRuntime` (the `when (ex is not OCE)` filter already propagates). Add tests asserting OCE propagates, `Canceled()` fires once, `*Failed` never fires — per engine/invoker/runtime.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small (code) + Medium (tests)
- **Breaking Change:** No — telemetry semantics only; dashboards counting execution-level cancellations drop to zero
- **Migration Impact:** Low
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Alerting math correct; invariant locked by tests
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

## High Priority Findings

### [HP-005] `UseSqliteContextStore` vs documented `UseSqliteProcessContextStore` — even the runtime warning is wrong

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** API naming / documentation drift
- **Description:** Method is `UseSqliteContextStore` (`src/Kaleido.Provider.SQLite/SqliteProcessContextStoreServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:10`). `AGENTS.md:83`, `src/AGENTS.md:69`, both `ARCHITECTURE.md`s, and the provider README all call it `UseSqliteProcessContextStore`. The runtime warning at `src/Kaleido/Process/Context/ProcessContextStore.cs:206` also names the nonexistent method — consumers following the product's own diagnostic get a compile error.
- **Why It Matters:** The canonical "get to durable state" instruction points at a nonexistent API.
- **Recommended Fix:** Rename the method to `UseSqliteProcessContextStore` (symmetric with `IProcessContextStore`); it's a trivially mechanical public break pre-release.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** Yes — Public API rename
- **Migration Impact:** Low (one-line rename at call sites)
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Log guidance, docs, and API agree
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-006] Docs teach an obsolete registration model (`AddAssembly`/`AddQueryable`/`AddProcessor`)

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Documentation — nonexistent/internal APIs
- **Description:** `src/Kaleido/README.md` bootstrap samples show `AddKaleido().AddAssembly(...).AddQueryable().AddProcessor(...)`. `AddAssembly` is internal (`KaleidoBuilder.cs:71`); `AddProcessor`/`AddQueryable` run automatically inside `AddKaleido` (`KaleidoServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:41-42`); assemblies come from `KaleidoServiceOptions.Assemblies`. `src/AGENTS.md` and `src/ARCHITECTURE.md` still describe `AddAssembly(...)` as the model.
- **Why It Matters:** The real registration model is only discoverable by reading `AddKaleido` source.
- **Recommended Fix:** Rewrite bootstrap sections to the options-based model in all contributor and project docs.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** No
- **Migration Impact:** None
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Docs teach the actual single entry point
- **Can Be Automated:** No

### [HP-007] Malformed correlation GUID header produces HTTP 500 instead of 400

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Error mapping — wrong status
- **Description:** `HttpCorrelationContextReader.ReadGuid` (`src/Kaleido.Http/Observability/HttpCorrelationContextReader.cs:56`) throws `BadHttpRequestException` inside `ObservabilityMiddleware`; `ExceptionMiddleware` (`ExceptionMiddleware.cs:118-141`) has no branch for it → generic catch → 500 `framework_error` + Error log. Found independently by three review threads (DS-01, OE-03, TD-10).
- **Why It Matters:** Bad client input pages on-call as a server failure and inflates `endpoint_errors` with `framework_error`.
- **Recommended Fix:** `catch (BadHttpRequestException)` → 400 `KaleidoErrorCodes.ArgumentError` in `ExceptionMiddleware`, or throw `KaleidoValidationException` in `ReadGuid`.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** Yes — behavioral (500→400 for malformed headers)
- **Migration Impact:** None for correct clients
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Correct status semantics; clean error budget
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-008] `ServiceName` doubles as route prefix; cross-service lowercase-key contract is undocumented

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Consumer experience — hidden coupling
- **Description:** `KaleidoServiceOptions.ServiceName` must be lowercase/no-separators and is reused as the route prefix (`ProcessEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs:39,48`); `AddHttpClients` derives the remote prefix by lowercasing the client config *key* (`KaleidoHttpClientsServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:32`). Misalignment ⇒ silent 404s on every remote call. Contract only documented in `src/ARCHITECTURE.md` (a contributor doc).
- **Why It Matters:** Two services must share an invisible string convention; renaming a service is a wire-breaking change.
- **Recommended Fix:** Document the ServiceName↔key↔RoutePrefix contract in consumer-facing docs; emit a startup log per client showing resolved prefix+BaseUrl; consider decoupling `RoutePrefix` from `ServiceName`.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** Yes if decoupled — Configuration
- **Migration Impact:** Medium
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Predictable distributed wiring
- **Can Be Automated:** No

### [HP-009] Production-unsafe defaults: all events discarded + unbounded in-memory state store

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Consumer experience — unsafe defaults (+ doc drift)
- **Description:** (a) Default `IEventPublisher` is `EventPublisher` (`Eventing/EventPublisher.cs:53`), which discards every event — the framework's *only* audit trail — with a one-time warning; docs still name it `NullEventPublisher` (`src/AGENTS.md:149`, `src/ARCHITECTURE.md`). (b) Default `IProcessContextStore` is an unbounded `ConcurrentDictionary` with no eviction (`ProcessContextStore.cs:193-207`), warning-only. A consumer can ship a service that loses all state on restart and all audit events forever. No health check surfaces either condition (LP-007).
- **Why It Matters:** Kaleido's value proposition is durable, observable processes; the defaults silently undermine both.
- **Recommended Fix:** Document both defaults in root README; fix `NullEventPublisher` references; consider a startup enforce option (e.g., `o.RequireDurableStore`) and/or a degraded health check.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** Yes if enforcing — Behavioral/Configuration
- **Migration Impact:** Medium
- **Long-Term Benefit:** No silent state/audit loss
- **Can Be Automated:** No

### [HP-010] Moq 4.20.72 ships SponsorLink (supply-chain/privacy); redundant direct `SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3`

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Build / supply chain
- **Description:** `tests/Directory.Packages.props:11` pins Moq ≥ 4.20, which executes SponsorLink during build and hashes git email (moq/moq#1372). Also `Kaleido.Provider.SQLite.csproj:5` references `SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3` directly although EF Core Sqlite already brings `bundle_e_sqlite3` transitively — potential duplicate native-asset conflicts in consumer apps.
- **Why It Matters:** Build-time telemetry in the toolchain; native loader conflicts downstream.
- **Recommended Fix:** Pin Moq ≤ 4.18.4 or migrate to NSubstitute; drop the direct SQLitePCLRaw reference unless an override is needed (document why).
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** No
- **Migration Impact:** Low
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Telemetry-free builds; clean dependency graph
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-011] `KaleidoClientOptions`/`KaleidoClientEntry` — HTTP config types living in transport-agnostic core

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Architecture — boundary leak
- **Description:** `src/Kaleido/KaleidoClientOptions.cs` defines `BaseUrl`/`RoutePrefix`/`Clients` in core, consumed only by `Kaleido.Http.Client` and abused as a DI marker in `MapRegistry` (`RegistryEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs:45`).
- **Why It Matters:** Core's charter is "free of transport-specific behavior"; the leak propagates to every future transport.
- **Recommended Fix:** Move both types to `Kaleido.Http.Client` (keep `Kaleido` namespace for source compat); add an explicit internal `IKaleidoClientsRegistered` marker for `MapRegistry`.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** Yes — types move assemblies (ABI break; source-compatible if namespace kept)
- **Migration Impact:** Recompile only
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Transport-pure core
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-012] `Assembly.GetCallingAssembly()` fallback is nondeterministic

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** API correctness — magic behavior
- **Description:** `KaleidoBuilder.cs:52` / `KaleidoServiceOptions.cs:46-48` default `Assemblies` to `GetCallingAssembly()`/`GetEntryAssembly()` — JIT-inlining-sensitive without `NoInlining`; wrapping `AddKaleido` in a helper silently scans the helper's assembly. Related: `AddKaleido` mandates `IConfiguration` and silently binds `Kaleido:*`.
- **Why It Matters:** The most common "my steps aren't discovered" bug class; varies by build config.
- **Recommended Fix:** Prefer explicit `Assemblies`; if the fallback stays, add `MethodImplOptions.NoInlining` + document; consider an analyzer (LP-016, KAL2003-family).
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small–Medium
- **Breaking Change:** Possibly — Behavioral
- **Migration Impact:** Medium
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Deterministic bootstrap; explicit registration per the framework's own principle
- **Can Be Automated:** No (analyzer: partially)

### [HP-013] `AddHttpClients` silently skips misconfigured clients; factories are scoped, defeating the client cache

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** API ergonomics — fail-slow + incorrect lifetime
- **Description:** `KaleidoHttpClientsServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:27-30` `continue`s past a client entry with no `BaseUrl` — a config typo produces a running app that fails later obscurely. Separately, both client factories + `ICorrelationHeaderStamper` are registered **scoped** (`KaleidoClientExtensions.cs:36-37`) while `KaleidoClientFactoryBase` caches clients in a per-instance dictionary — the cache never survives a scope. Base class also holds an unused `CorrelationAccessor`; `ICorrelationHeaderStamper.Sanitize` is dead API; cached clients' `IDisposable` is never invoked.
- **Why It Matters:** Violates fail-fast philosophy; the registry cache (the clients' main cost avoidance) doesn't work; stale-after-deploy caching is also undocumented (see LP-014).
- **Recommended Fix:** Throw `KaleidoConfigurationException` naming the key; register factories singleton; remove dead members; make `AddProcessClient`/`AddQueryableClient` public (currently internal — MP-026).
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** Behavioral (startup throws on bad config — intended)
- **Migration Impact:** Broken configs surface immediately
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Startup correctness; working cache
- **Can Be Automated:** Mostly

### [HP-014] `ValidatePage` silently accepts invalid paging + wrong error message

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Validation bug
- **Description:** `QueryRequestValidator.cs:283-311`: `Page` on a non-`[Pageable]` context is silently accepted; `Size <= 0` throws a "exceeds maximum" message (wrong failure); negative `Offset` never validated.
- **Recommended Fix:** Reject `Page` when `pageable is null` (new `qry_*` code), fix message, validate `Offset >= 0`.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** Yes — behavioral (previously accepted requests → 400)
- **Migration Impact:** Low
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Validation matches documented `[Pageable]` semantics
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-015] Endpoint name typo: `KaleidoProcessStepREgistry`

- **Severity:** High (cheap to fix now, permanent if shipped)
- **Category:** Public contract bug
- **Description:** `Kaleido.Http.Abstractions/Process/ProcessRoutes.cs:66` — capital E in `"KaleidoProcessStepREgistry"`; emitted via `WithName()` into route metadata/OpenAPI operation IDs.
- **Recommended Fix:** Fix before release; cover with proposed analyzer KAL0020 (LP-016).
- **Estimated Complexity:** Small
- **Breaking Change:** Yes — observable endpoint name (compile-time const; C# consumers unaffected)
- **Migration Impact:** Link-by-name consumers update string
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-016] Step exceptions are swallowed into HTTP 200; error taxonomy lost at the boundary

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Exception strategy — information loss
- **Description:** `ProcessExecutor.cs:214-253` converts *any* exception (including `KaleidoValidationException`) into a step outcome `Status=Exception`; response is 200 with generic `framework_exception` text — `Code` discarded, real message replaced. Companion gap: `KaleidoHttpClientException` on the client side never reads the server `KaleidoErrorResponse` body — `Errors` is dead surface and `httpclient_validation_failed` is defined but unused.
- **Recommended Fix:** Preserve `Code` on `ProcessExecutionOutcome`/`RuntimeMessages`; on non-2xx client paths, deserialize `KaleidoErrorResponse` into `Errors` and map 400→`ValidationFailed`.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** Possibly — response contract gains a field; client error codes change for 400s
- **Migration Impact:** Low
- **Long-Term Benefit:** Error taxonomy survives step + wire boundaries
- **Can Be Automated:** No

### [HP-017] SQLite store test coverage is thin; no concurrency coverage

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Testing — missing critical-path tests
- **Description:** `SqliteProcessContextStoreTests.cs` has 2 tests; round-trip asserts only `ProcessId` (steps, state, timestamps, `RequiredStep` unverified). No concurrency/update/multi-instance/cancellation tests; `tests/AGENTS.md:12` still labels the project "(placeholder)".
- **Recommended Fix:** Full-fidelity round-trip asserts; parallel save/load; update-existing; DI-lifetime validation; fix AGENTS.md label.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Medium
- **Breaking Change:** No
- **Migration Impact:** None
- **Can Be Automated:** Yes

### [HP-018] `ExecutionProcessorTests` (1,395 lines) is severely over-mocked and brittle

- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Test maintainability
- **Description:** 5–9 hand-wired mocks per test, ~150–250 lines of setup, strict mocks, `VerifyNoOtherCalls` on five mocks, a mocked `IDisposable.Dispose` — internals-coupled assertions that resist refactoring; violates `tests/AGENTS.md` seam-testing guidance.
- **Recommended Fix:** Extract a builder/fixture; assert outcomes not call counts; drop strict/`VerifyNoOtherCalls`.
- **Estimated Complexity:** Large (file rewrite)
- **Breaking Change:** No
- **Migration Impact:** None
- **Can Be Automated:** No

## Medium Priority Findings

### [MP-005] `MapProcessor()` throws for query-only services; no per-runtime opt-out

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Surprising failure
- **Description:** `AddKaleido` always registers both runtimes; `MapProcessor()` throws `KaleidoConfigurationException` when no steps exist, yet README shows both `Map` calls unconditionally. No `EnableProcess`/`EnableQueryable` opt-out.
- **Recommended Fix:** No-op-with-warning, or explicit enable flags in `KaleidoServiceOptions`.
- **Complexity:** Small–Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — behavioral · **Migration:** Low · **Automatable:** No

### [MP-006] Middleware pipeline installed invisibly via `IStartupFilter`; no opt-out or ordering control documented

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Hidden behavior
- **Description:** `AddHttp()` registers `KaleidoStartupFilter` (`KaleidoHttpServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:25`) inserting Exception+Observability middleware with no `app.Use*` trace, no reorder seam, no opt-out.
- **Recommended Fix:** Document pipeline position; consider `AddHttp(o => o.Middleware...)` options.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No (docs); Yes if options added — Configuration · **Automatable:** No

### [MP-007] `GuardQueryAsync` duplicates `ExceptionMiddleware` and bypasses its telemetry

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Duplicate error handling / telemetry gap
- **Description:** `QueryableEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs:418-437` catches `KaleidoValidationException` in the endpoint — identical wire shape but skips `Activity.SetStatus(Error)` and `endpoint_errors` counting (process path goes through middleware). Two pipelines for one exception type.
- **Recommended Fix:** Delete `GuardQueryAsync`; let `ExceptionMiddleware` own 400 mapping.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-008] `MapRegistry` unconditionally requires both client factories + uses options type as a marker

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Fragile DI contract
- **Description:** `RegistryEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs:42-51,84-86` — injects both `IKaleido*ClientFactory`; throws if only one client kind registered; `KaleidoClientOptions` presence is sniffed as a lifecycle marker.
- **Recommended Fix:** Resolve via `GetService<T>` in-handler; explicit marker type (see HP-011).
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-009] Per-request reflection on hot paths

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Performance
- **Description:** `ProcessStepInvoker.cs:86-94` — `GetMethod`+`Invoke` per step. `QueryableService.cs:123-242`, `QueryContextEngine.cs:238-247`, `DelegatedQueryViewEngine.cs:56-66` — `MakeGenericMethod`/`GetMethod`+`Invoke` per query. `DataTypeMapper.cs:144` — `new NullabilityInfoContext()` per property. `StepCandidateBuilder.cs:75-81` — JSON serialize→deserialize round-trip for already-typed in-process step objects.
- **Recommended Fix:** Cache `MethodInfo`/compiled delegates at registration; static `NullabilityInfoContext`; short-circuit `values is T`.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No (subtle copy-semantics change for the step short-circuit — flag) · **Automatable:** Partially

### [MP-010] `QueryEventFactory` copies the full result set into every event — even with the no-op publisher

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Performance / allocation
- **Description:** `QueryEventFactory.cs:43` — `Records = result.Results.Cast<object?>().ToArray()` on every query; pure waste with the default discarding publisher; scales with page size.
- **Recommended Fix:** Skip construction for no-op publisher or cap payload.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly — event contract · **Automatable:** No

### [MP-011] "Execution completed" Information signal fires on failed/canceled runs

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Telemetry consistency
- **Description:** `ProcessExecutor` converts step failure/cancel into a normal return; `ProcessRuntime` then emits `ExecutionCompleted` — the single Information log claims success on a degraded run.
- **Recommended Fix:** Outcome-aware completion (`execution.status = completed|degraded|canceled` tag / failedStepCount).
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Additive · **Automatable:** No

### [MP-012] Client-side registry cache never invalidates; `Reset` blocks a thread-pool thread

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Distributed-systems correctness
- **Description:** Clients cache the remote registry for instance lifetime — remote redeploys invisible until restart (undocumented). `HttpClientRegistryCache.Reset` does a synchronous `_lock.Wait()` (`HttpClientRegistryCache.cs:23`) that can block across an in-flight HTTP fetch.
- **Recommended Fix:** Document + consider TTL/refresh; make reset non-blocking (`Interlocked.Exchange`).
- **Complexity:** Small–Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly — `InvalidateRegistry` signature · **Automatable:** No

### [MP-013] `ProcessResponseFactory` — public server-side projection inside the shared contract assembly

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Wrong project boundary / public surface
- **Description:** `Kaleido.Http.Abstractions/Process/ProcessResponseFactory.cs` consumes core runtime DTOs; public "for test mocking." Wrong layer per `src/AGENTS.md` and inconsistent with the queryable side's static `FromRegistryItem` pattern. (Merges TD-19/TD-24, AP-06.)
- **Recommended Fix:** Move to `src/Kaleido.Http` as internal statics (InternalsVisibleTo covers tests).
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Yes — public type removal/move · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-014] Registry aggregation follows remote-supplied URLs without validation (SSRF surface)

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Security — client trust boundary
- **Description:** `KaleidoProcessClient`/`KaleidoQueryableClient` issue requests to `MetadataUrl`/`QueryUrl`/`ExecuteUrl` verbatim from registry responses — no scheme/host check.
- **Recommended Fix:** Validate resolved URI is same-host/allowed-scheme relative to `BaseAddress`.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Possibly — exotic legit topologies · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-015] SQLite provider telemetry is invisible to `AddKaleidoInstrumentation`

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Observability gap
- **Description:** `SqliteTelemetry` defines `ActivitySourceName`/`MeterName`, but `AddKaleidoInstrumentation` registers only Process/Queryable/HTTP — provider spans/meters never export.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `AddKaleidoSqliteInstrumentation()` per the provider pattern (keeps OTel→SQLite decoupled).
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-016] Public-surface inconsistencies: implementations, registries, SQLite internals

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Public surface area
- **Description:** Public concrete classes behind `TryAddSingleton<IX,X>` (`EventPublisher`, `ValueConverter`, `DataTypeMapper`, `ConstraintMapper`) vs the internal-implementation convention; six registry interfaces public only because `Map*` resolves them; SQLite provider exposes DbContext/entities/`SqliteTelemetry` publicly with no `DbContextOptionsBuilder` hook; `KaleidoServiceOptions.Validate` public static.
- **Recommended Fix:** Internalize implementations (or annotate registries as infrastructure); internalize SQLite surface + add options-builder overload.
- **Complexity:** Small–Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — visibility reductions · **Automatable:** Mostly

### [MP-017] Analyzer suite gaps: undocumented rules, weak rules, dead test-seam convention

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Tooling/docs
- **Description:** `KAL1010`/`KAL1011` absent from ANALYZERS.md; `KAL1009` high-maintenance — recommend Info; `KAL1003` brittle to layout; `SutFixture` convention enforced by analyzers but used by ~2 test classes and undocumented in `tests/AGENTS.md`; `AnalyzerTestBase` duplicated across two test projects; `Kaleido.Analyzers` csproj `IsPackable=true` with no packaging metadata/`analyzers/dotnet/cs` layout; `Kaleido.Analyzers.UnitTests` reduced to a "moved" stub file.
- **Recommended Fix:** Update ANALYZERS.md + `tools/analyzers` guide; demote KAL1009; decide SutFixture fate (adopt broadly + document, or retire + analyzers); consolidate test harness; set `IsPackable=false` or add proper pack metadata; delete stub project.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Partially

### [MP-018] `ProcessStepRegistry` 4-pass materialization pipeline is over-engineered

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Removable internal complexity
- **Description:** `TypeDefinition → Definition → Node → Slot` records + public `ProcessStepDependencyGraph` exist only to shuttle data between private methods — ~250 lines collapsible to a single `BuildRegistration`.
- **Recommended Fix:** Collapse the pipeline; verify `ProcessStepDependencyGraph` has no external consumers then internalize/delete.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes if public record removed · **Automatable:** No

### [MP-019] Test gaps on published invariants + dead/stub test files

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Testing
- **Description:** Queryable dispatch precedence never tested as an ordering; functional tests lack 500-shape/correlation-echo/cancellation/durable-store coverage; `Kaleido.Http.Abstractions` has no serialization round-trip/contract tests; `HttpHeaderSanitizerTests.cs` is a 1-line empty file (standalone — see CR note below); `tests/Kaleido.UnitTests/QueryableValueNormalizerTests.cs` empty + wrong project; `DbContextDependencyTests` resolve-but-never-execute and skip `ValidateScopes`; `KaleidoStartupFilterTests` never asserts middleware ordering; `DelegatedQueryViewEngineTests` asserts `new() != null`; brittle literal-JSON assertion in ExceptionMiddlewareTests; zero `[Theory]`s in ~610 tests.
- **Recommended Fix:** See per-item fixes in TQ findings; note the empty sanitizer test file should be filled, not deleted.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-020] Duplication blocks: `FieldLookup`×3, view-registry builders, handler-scan predicates

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Duplicate code
- **Description:** Identical `FieldLookup` in `QueryRequestCompiler`, `QueryRequestValidator`, `QueryableValueNormalizer` (crosses project boundary); `IsProcessStepHandler`/`ImplementsGenericInterfaceFor`/`GetQueryViewInterface` duplicated between registration scans and registries; ~120 near-verbatim metadata-builder lines shared between `QueryViewRegistry` and `DelegatedQueryViewRegistry`.
- **Recommended Fix:** Single `FieldLookup`/`QueryMetadataBuilder` in `Kaleido/Queryable/Metadata`; route interface discovery through existing `QueryViewTypeExtensions`.
- **Complexity:** Small–Medium · **Breaking:** No (all internal) · **Automatable:** Mostly

### [MP-021] Contract-model duplications and shadowed `new` inheritance

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Contract design
- **Description:** `QueryApiRequest` vs `QueryRequest`, `ExecuteProcessRequest`/`ExecuteStepRequest<T>` vs `ProcessRequest`/`ProcessorRequest` — parallel wire/domain vocabularies; `QueryableViewResponse`/`QueryableRecordResponse` re-declare inherited members with `new` making JSON shape depend on static type; `ProcessorRegistryResponse` vs `ProcessorCatalogResponse` near-duplicates; `RepeatableOptions` single-bool wrapper; `EmptyQueryViewParameters` exists only to satisfy arity.
- **Recommended Fix:** Prefer composition/self-contained wire records (Process-side pattern); consistent `*Contract` naming; flatten `RepeatableOptions`.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — contract shapes · **Automatable:** Partially

### [MP-022] Stale directories and review/build artifacts in repo root

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Repo hygiene / release readiness
- **Description:** `src/Core/` and `src/Kaleido.AspNetCore/` contain only stale `bin/obj` (no csproj/source) yet mislead readers and tooling; root holds `kaleido-context.xml` (~1.1MB dump), `cleanup chatgpt ent.md`, `cleanup copilot.md`; `docs/archive/` holds 20+ session summaries. (`TestResults/` is gitignored — fine.)
- **Recommended Fix:** Delete stale dirs and stray artifacts or move under `docs/archive/`; gitignore the context dump.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-023] `tests/AGENTS.md` missing 4 projects; `tools/analyzers` undocumented; `ERROR_CODES.md`/`ANALYZERS.md` not linked

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Documentation coverage
- **Description:** tests table lists 6 of 9 projects (missing IntegrationTests + 3 analyzer test projects); `tools/analyzers` has no README/AGENTS (build/pack/test workflow undocumented); README's Documentation Map links the nonexistent AspNetCore README while omitting `docs/ERROR_CODES.md`, `docs/ANALYZERS.md`, and the OTel README; docs still name `KaleidoProcessClientException`/`KaleidoQueryableClientException` (real: `KaleidoHttpClientException`).
- **Recommended Fix:** Update tables/maps; add `tools/analyzers` guide; fix exception names.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Partially

### [MP-024] Release-pipeline gaps: lock files, pack step, coverage gate, warnings-as-errors scope

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Build/CI hardening (corrected CR-002 detail)
- **Description:** No `packages.lock.json`/`RestoreLockedMode` (plain `dotnet restore` in `build.yml`); no `dotnet pack`/release job despite full nupkg metadata; coverage uploaded but ungated; `TreatWarningsAsErrors`+`EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` only in `src/`.
- **Recommended Fix:** Enable lock-file restore in CI + commit locks; add pack step; coverage threshold; move warnings-as-errors to root props.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-025] Client registration is config-only; programmatic `AddProcessClient`/`AddQueryableClient` are internal

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** API ergonomics / discoverability
- **Description:** Public `KaleidoHttpClientOptions` has no public consumer API; `AddHttpClients` always registers both client kinds per entry regardless of downstream capabilities.
- **Recommended Fix:** Make per-kind registrations public on `IKaleidoBuilder`; optional capability flag per config entry.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No — additive · **Automatable:** Yes

### [MP-026] Registry endpoint always 200 with `ClientErrors`; step-name resolution diverges client vs server

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Failure semantics / convention drift
- **Description:** `MapRegistry` always returns 200 — degradation invisible to health checks/gateways (deliberate but under-documented). Client resolves step names by stripping `"Step"` from `typeof(TStep).Name` (`KaleidoProcessClient.cs:218-222`) while the server uses `[ProcessStep].Name` — a custom-named step silently 404s.
- **Recommended Fix:** Document 200-with-errors contract (+ consider `?strict` mode or `Partial` flag); read the attribute in the client first.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Additive/bug-fix · **Automatable:** Yes

---

## Low Priority Findings

### [LP-004] Logging/telemetry micro-inconsistencies
- **Description:** `ExceptionMiddleware` logs client disconnect at Debug while convention assigns cancellations to Warning (`ExceptionMiddleware.cs:23-27` vs `ProcessObservability.cs:368`); failure `ActivityEvent`s lack `exception.*` tags — prefer `activity.AddException(ex)` (`ProcessObservability.cs:343,430,468`; `QueryableObservability.cs:247`); metric tag keys are scattered literals (`"step.name"`, `"query.view"`, `"execution.status"`) vs `kaleido.*` activity constants — centralize in `*Telemetry` classes; `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` on logic-bearing `QueryableObservability.cs:54`; event-type strings are magic literals ("process.created.v1"); `WriteResponseHeaders` duplicates middleware echo (`ProcessExecutionService.cs:138-157`) — keep only server-assigned `ProcessId`.
- **Fix:** Small alignment sweep. **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-005] Dependency nits
- **Description:** `Kaleido.csproj` references full `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` (abstractions suffice); redundant direct ProjectReferences in `Kaleido.Http.Client`/`Observability.OpenTelemetry` csprojs.
- **Fix:** Trim references. **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-006] Input-validation hardening
- **Description:** `UseSqliteContextStore` only null-checks the connection string — parse via `SqliteConnectionStringBuilder` + `KaleidoConfigurationException`.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Fails earlier (good) · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-007] No health-check story outside SQLite
- **Description:** Only the SQLite provider registers health checks; nothing surfaces "in-memory store / no-op publisher" to readiness probes.
- **Fix:** `KaleidoHealthCheck` reporting degraded for unsafe defaults (ties to HP-009). **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** No

### [LP-008] `HttpHeaderSanitizer` allocates 3× per header per request
- **Description:** `Where().ToArray()` LINQ path (`HttpHeaderSanitizer.cs:24-25`) on up to 5 headers inbound + outbound every call; common case is already-clean.
- **Fix:** Fast path scan → return original; `string.Create` only when mutating. **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** No

### [LP-009] Minor code-organization nits
- **Description:** `RegistryEndpointNames` is a non-static `sealed class` (others are `static class`); `ProcessEndpointNames` public but `QueryableEndpointNames`/`QueryableRoutePaths` public in the wrong assembly while `ProcessRoutePaths` is internal — consolidate constants policy; `RouteOptionsMap` subclasses, 6-line factory interfaces, `QueryViewVisibility` warrant colocation; `ProcessStepRegistry.Helpers.cs` asymmetric partial; commented-out `FilterOperator` members (`Enumerations.cs:58-65`); `ProcessorStepRegistryItem` unsealed records; redundant `as` cast in `QueryEventFactory.cs:44`; sort-to-select-one in `ProcessExecutionService.cs:122-130` → single-pass.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Partial (const class shape, visibility) · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-010] `KaleidoHttpTelemetry` placement couples OTel provider to HTTP contracts
- **Description:** `Kaleido.Http.Abstractions/KaleidoHttpTelemetry.cs` forces `Kaleido.Observability.OpenTelemetry` to reference the HTTP contract package just for meter names.
- **Fix:** Move/split constants. **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Yes — type moves assemblies · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-011] Per-step endpoint contract (`ExecuteStepRequest<TStep>` envelope) undocumented for non-.NET consumers
- **Description:** Per-step execute bodies use a reflection-generated envelope; no consumer doc or OpenAPI output describes it; `.WithTags("Kaleido")`/`.Produces` metadata suggests OpenAPI was intended.
- **Fix:** Contract doc or ship OpenAPI description. **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Partially

### [LP-012] Small API-consistency fixes
- **Description:** `ProcessStepHandlerResult` non-generic record unsealed + ambiguous `Success` overloads (`Success(string? = null, params …)` vs `Success(params …)`); Process attributes unsealed vs sealed Queryable attributes; `IEventPublisher.PublishAsync<TEvent,TContext>` leaves `TContext` unconstrained (add `IKaleidoEventContext` marker); `AddHttp` descriptor-sniffs `IProcessRegistry` for conditional registration (order-fragile — register unconditionally); `IKaleidoBuilder` grew past its `Services`+`Assemblies` charter (freeze at 4 members).
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Yes (sealing/constraint/overload — low real impact) · **Automatable:** Mostly

### [LP-013] Test-style findings
- **Description:** Zero `[Theory]` usage; literal-JSON equality assertion (`ExceptionMiddlewareTests.cs:52-54`) → deserialize + assert fields; folder↔namespace mismatches (`Query/` vs `Queryable/` tree, extra `Processor` segment); inconsistent test-class accessibility.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-014] Client registry cache lifetime undocumented
- **Description:** Registry cached for client lifetime; remote redeploys invisible until restart (pairs with MP-012 mechanics).
- **Fix:** Document + recommend lifetimes/TTL. **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** No

### [LP-015] `RegistryEndpointNames`/`GetAll()` dead surface + misc dead code
- **Description:** `QueryContextRegistry.GetAll()`/`QueryViewRegistry.GetAll()` public-but-not-on-interface dead methods; `ICorrelationHeaderStamper.Sanitize` never called; `CorrelationAccessor` unused in client factory base.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Internal only · **Automatable:** Yes

### [LP-016] Analyzer proposals — see dedicated section below

## Analyzer Proposals

(Phase 14 output. Existing suite assessment: keep KAL0002–0019 suite — no built-in equivalents for the DI-hygiene rules; demote KAL1009 to Info; document KAL1010/1011 — see MP-017.)

| ID Proposal | Purpose | Problem Solved | Example Violation | Severity | Impl. Complexity | Long-Term Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **KAL0020** | `.WithName(...)` args must reference `*EndpointNames` consts | Convention documented but unenforced — how `KaleidoProcessStepREgistry` shipped (HP-015) | `.WithName("GetSteps")` | Warning | Small | High |
| **KAL0021** | `catch (Exception)` touching observability members must filter OCE | AGENTS.md invariant enforced only by review (see CR-007) | `catch (Exception ex) { obs.Failed(ex); }` | Warning | Medium | Medium-High |
| **KAL2001** (consumer pkg) | `[ProcessStep]`/`[QueryView]` required + non-empty Name/Version on types used as step/view generic args | Startup-time failures for compile-time-knowable facts | `IProcessStepHandler<T>` where `T` lacks `[ProcessStep]` | Error | Medium | High — flagship consumer rule |
| **KAL2002** (consumer) | Consumer step handlers: catch-all must exclude OCE | Same invariant at the consumer seam | as KAL0021 | Warning | Medium | Medium |
| **KAL2003** (consumer) | `ServiceName` literal must satisfy lowercase/no-separator rule at compile time | Startup throw for a literal-known violation | `o.ServiceName = "Intake Service"` | Warning | Small | Medium |
| **KAL2004** (consumer) | `MapRegistry()` without upstream `AddHttpClients()` in the same fluent chain | Runtime guard exists; compile-time hint | `app.MapRegistry()` alone | Info (heuristic) | Medium | Medium |

## Consolidated Breaking-Change List

| ID | Current | Proposed | Why Break Now | Scope | Migration |
|----|---------|----------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| HP-005 | `UseSqliteContextStore` | `UseSqliteProcessContextStore` | Docs/warning already say it | Public API | Rename call site |

| MP-016 | Public impls/registries/SQLite types | Internalize (+ `DbContextOptionsBuilder` hook) | Honest surface | Public API | Recompile |
| MP-018 | 4-pass registry records + public `ProcessStepDependencyGraph` | Collapse; internalize | Simplicity | Public API (one record) | Recompile |

| CR-001(de-scoped) | — | Plug boundary leaks instead of splitting | See v1 validation | — | — |
| EXT-01 | `Load`/`Save` store contract | Versioned CAS + idempotency | Distributed correctness can't be bolted on | Public API/schema | High |
| EXT-02 | Save→publish as separate ops | Transactional outbox / recoverable commit | Doc-only guidance can't reconcile split commits | Public API/schema | High |
| EXT-04 | Full-payload events | Metadata-only default + payload policy | Warnings don't prevent sensitive replication | Event contract | High |
| EXT-06 | `AddKaleido` auto-enables both runtimes | Explicit `AddProcess`/`AddQueryable` (or enable flags) | Magic registration hides accepted defaults | Public API/Behavioral | Medium |
| EXT-07 | `Map*` → `IEndpointRouteBuilder` | Convention/group builders | Auth can't compose today | Public API | Low–Med |
| EXT-08 | Parallel sync/async/delegated source families + registries | One async-first contract + one catalog | Combinatorial API before proven need | Public API | High |
| EXT-09 | Interface-per-stage Process internals | Cohesive internal components | Internal — freedom pre-1.0 | Internal | Low |
| EXT-10 | `IDataTypeMapper` + `IValueConverter` overlap | One conversion service | Two systems diverge | Public API/Internal | Medium |
| EXT-11 | Mandatory `totalCount` | Optional count / `HasMore` | Two provider ops per query | Contract | Medium |
| EXT-16 | Mutable manually-bound options | `ValidateOnStart` + immutable snapshots | Convention + safety | Configuration | Low–Med |
| EXT-18 | Process/Processor, Delegate/Delegated names | One glossary | Consistency window closes at 1.0 | Public API | Medium |

All changes must update: relevant tests, `docs/ERROR_CODES.md` (if codes added), READMEs, and the HTTP contract docs together — per the "shared boundary" rule.

## External Review Merge (cleanup chatgpt ent.md + cleanup copilot.md)

Two independent external reviews were merged into this document. **Provenance caveat:** both were performed against `kaleido-context.xml` (a compressed Repomix export), not a live checkout — several of their claims are therefore stale (e.g., Copilot F-01 "no CI evidence" — `.github/workflows/build.yml` exists; F-06 broken doc links — partially stale). Items below were re-validated against source where feasible; unverifiable claims are marked.

### Conflicting guidance to resolve in design review

- **Analyzer dispositions:** v2 review recommends keeping the KAL DI-hygiene suite; both external reviews recommend deleting/demoting several rules (KAL0003 `!`-ban, KAL0015, KAL1001–1004/1006–1009 layout rules; external reviews keep only KAL0004/0007/0009/0013/0014/1005 as errors). Decide one disposition table — see MP-017/Q-006.
- **Analyzer proposals overlap:** their KAL2001–2003 (step/query/DTO validity) ≈ our KAL2001/KAL2003; their KAL0020–0022 (dup registration, in-memory-store warning, cancellation forwarding) ≈ our KAL2004/KAL0021-family. Consolidated into one table below (AN-EXT).

### New findings from external reviews

#### [EXT-01] `IProcessContextStore` has no optimistic concurrency or idempotency contract — **CRITICAL**

- **Severity:** Critical · **Category:** Process correctness / concurrency
- **Description:** Contract is `LoadAsync`/`SaveAsync` only — no version/ETag, CAS result, lease, or conflict outcome. Two concurrent requests for the same process can both plan against the same state, execute side effects, and overwrite each other; the pre-persistence non-repeatable check doesn't close the race. No durable idempotency key/replay contract for retries. (KAL-C02)
- **Recommended Fix:** Versioned snapshot with CAS save; first-class idempotency key + durable request outcome; per-process concurrency/conflict/retry tests on every durable provider.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Yes — Public API/Behavioral/Package/schema · **Migration:** High · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-02] State save and event publish are not atomic — **CRITICAL**

- **Severity:** Critical · **Category:** Process reliability / eventing
- **Description:** `ExecutionProcessor` saves state then publishes the step-completed event as separate operations; no outbox/commit protocol. A publisher failure after commit leaves durable state without its audit event; retrying can duplicate effects. (KAL-C03)
- **Recommended Fix:** Transactional outbox owned by the store transaction (stable event IDs, retry status, idempotent delivery), or an explicit recoverable commit contract + recovery API; fault-injection tests around the commit boundary.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Yes — Public API/Behavioral/schema · **Migration:** High · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-03] Queryable async APIs run synchronous provider I/O — **CRITICAL, VERIFIED**

- **Severity:** Critical · **Category:** Correctness / scalability
- **Description:** Verified: `QueryContextExecutor.cs:15-25` — `CountAsync` returns `Task.FromResult(query.Count())`, `ToListAsync` returns `Task.FromResult(query.ToList())`. Against EF Core this is synchronous DB I/O on request threads; cancellation can't interrupt the provider call. Tests only use LINQ-to-Objects so the hazard is invisible. (KAL-C04)
- **Recommended Fix:** Provider-aware async materialization abstraction on the query source (keeps core provider-neutral), or an EF adapter package; keep sync path only for in-memory sources; load tests with a real relational provider.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly — source-provider contracts · **Migration:** Low–Medium · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-04] Default event payloads replicate full business records — **CRITICAL**

- **Severity:** Critical · **Category:** Security/privacy
- **Description:** Events carry process requests/responses and full query result sets (`QueryEventFactory.cs:43`); no redaction, field classification, size cap, or metadata-only mode. PII/financial fields can be duplicated into an uncontrolled pipeline. (KAL-C05; perf angle = MP-010)
- **Recommended Fix:** Metadata-only default + explicit opt-in payload policy, redaction hooks, size cap; tests proving sensitive values never enter default events/logs/tags.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Yes — event contract · **Migration:** High · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-05] `Kaleido.Analyzers` is a packable package containing zero rules — **HIGH, VERIFIED**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Packaging
- **Description:** Verified: `tools/analyzers/Kaleido.Analyzers/` contains only `DiagnosticIds.cs` and an empty `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md`, yet `IsPackable=true` + `DevelopmentDependency=true`, and nothing packages `Kaleido.Analyzers.Source`/`.Testing` into `analyzers/dotnet/cs`. Published as-is it's an inert, misleading package. (KAL-C07)
- **Recommended Fix:** Decide: delete the package (repo-only tooling) or ship a deliberate consumer analyzer assembly (KAL2xxx) with proper pack layout + a pack-and-consume smoke test. Folded into MP-017 scope.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Package · **Migration:** Low · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-06] `AddKaleido` implicitly enables both capabilities — elevated to High

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** API design (merges MP-005 + KAL-H01)
- **Description:** External review concurs and strengthens: implicit dual registration broadens the graph, hides accepted defaults, and prevents expressing intent. Recommended: `AddKaleido(...).AddProcess()/.AddQueryable()/.AddHttp()/.AddHttpClients()` or explicit `Enable*` options.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — Public API/Behavioral · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-07] `Map*` methods return `IEndpointRouteBuilder` — authorization can't compose — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Security / endpoint ergonomics
- **Description:** `MapProcessor`/`MapQueryable`/`MapRegistry` return `IEndpointRouteBuilder`, so consumers can't chain `.RequireAuthorization()`/endpoint conventions; docs recommend `MapGroup` wrapping as a workaround. Endpoints execute steps, query data, and expose registry metadata with no framework auth posture. (KAL-H09)
- **Recommended Fix:** Return `IEndpointConventionBuilder`/`RouteGroupBuilder` (or one `MapKaleido()` group); document the unauthenticated default; authorization integration tests (401/403).
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — Public API · **Migration:** Low–Medium · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-08] Queryable surface proliferates: registries × parallel source families — **HIGH** ✅ RESOLVED

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Bloat / API design
- **Description:** Separate context/local-view/delegated-view/aggregate registries + eight sync/async/generic `QuerySources.cs` shapes + client interfaces in `Http.Abstractions`. (KAL-H11, F-04, part of KAL-H04)
- **Resolution:** `IQueryContextRegistry`, `IQueryViewRegistry`, and `IDelegatedQueryViewRegistry` are now internal. `IQueryableRegistry` is the only public registry interface. `QueryableContextRegistryItem` now carries `ContextType`; `QueryableViewRegistryItem` carries `QueryViewType`/`ViewType`/`ViewParametersType` for transport wiring. `MapQueryable` is unified into one loop over `IQueryableRegistry.Registrations` — local and delegated views are transparent to all transports. `QueryableService` dispatch order (delegated → local view → direct context) remains unchanged, handled internally by the service.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Yes — Public API · **Migration:** High · **Automatable:** No

#### [EXT-09] Process execution decomposed into interface-per-stage — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Bloat / testability
- **Description:** Planner, candidate builder, validator, consistency checker, availability resolver, evaluator, state updater, invoker, event factory, observability — each a one-implementation internal interface; tests mirror the graph (see HP-018). (KAL-H12)
- **Recommended Fix:** Collapse into cohesive internal `ProcessPlanner`/`ProcessExecutor`/`ProcessStateMachine`; test behavior at boundaries.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Internal only · **Automatable:** No
- **Resolution:** Each stage class retains its own interface and DI registration — every class is a valid independently-testable SUT with a cuttable seam. The fix addressed the naming inconsistency (EXT-18 / KAL-M09): `ExecutionPlanner`→`ProcessPlanner`/`IProcessPlanner` and `ExecutionProcessor`→`ProcessExecutor`/`IProcessExecutor`, aligning with the established `Process*` naming convention. `ProcessRuntime` now injects `IProcessPlanner` + `IProcessExecutor`. DI registrations and test files updated accordingly. All 738 tests pass.

#### [EXT-10] Duplicate conversion systems (`IDataTypeMapper` vs `IValueConverter`) — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Technical debt
- **Description:** Two public overlapping conversion stacks plus a third seam in `QueryableValueNormalizer` — divergence risk in formats/null/culture/error codes. (KAL-H13)
- **Recommended Fix:** One internal conversion service (non-throwing result API + throwing wrapper); keep metadata description separate.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes if interfaces removed · **Migration:** Medium · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-11] Every query runs a mandatory `totalCount` — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Performance / contract
- **Description:** `QueryContextEngine` always counts before materializing the page — two provider ops per query; counts can exceed page-retrieval cost. (KAL-H15)
- **Recommended Fix:** Optional `IncludeTotalCount` / `HasMore` semantics; document exact-vs-omitted behavior.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — contract/behavioral · **Migration:** Medium · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-12] Inbound correlation headers are trusted as framework identity — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Security — correlation trust
- **Description:** Sanitized `X-Kaleido-*` values feed context, Activity tags, outbound + response headers — caller-controlled provenance (source processor/step/request identity spoofable in traces/audit). (KAL-M01)
- **Recommended Fix:** Document trust boundary; allow regenerate/reject policies for external headers; don't treat caller values as authoritative audit identity.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly — behavioral/config · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-13] Registry `refresh` triggers unbounded downstream fan-out — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Availability / abuse resistance
- **Description:** `?refresh` fans out to all downstream clients with no visible bounds, auth, or rate limiting; no documented request/size limits elsewhere either. (KAL-M02)
- **Recommended Fix:** Bounded fan-out defaults, protect refresh (auth/rate-limit), documented resource limits; abuse tests.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-14] Case-insensitive filters use culture-sensitive `ToLower()` — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Queryable semantics / perf
- **Description:** `CompiledQueryApplier` builds `LOWER(member) == lowered` — embeds collation choice, can defeat index seeks, varies by provider. (KAL-M03)
- **Recommended Fix:** Explicit case-sensitivity metadata; provider-native case-insensitive translation where available.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** If semantics change · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-15] SQLite store rewrites all child rows per save — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Persistence perf
- **Description:** `SqliteProcessContextStore` deletes/recreates step/availability rows on every save — write amplification, lock duration, WAL growth scaling with process size. (KAL-M04)
- **Recommended Fix:** After EXT-01 semantics, compare targeted updates vs serialized snapshot column; benchmark.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly — schema · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-16] Mutable options objects, manual binding, manual validation — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Configuration conventions
- **Description:** `KaleidoServiceOptions` non-sealed/mutable, manually bound, registered singleton; `KaleidoHttpClientOptions` assembled separately. Unconventional for .NET consumers; mutation-after-startup possible. (KAL-M06, F-18)
- **Recommended Fix:** `AddOptions` + bind + `Validate` + `ValidateOnStart`; immutable snapshots at runtime; seal option types.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly — config surface · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-17] Offset-only paging; no keyset/continuation — **LOW→POST-1.0**

- **Severity:** Medium (design) / Low (urgency) · **Category:** Scalability
- **Description:** `Skip/Take` only; large offsets degrade and unstable under writes. (KAL-M08)
- **Recommended Fix:** Optional keyset/continuation contract + deterministic-sort requirement. Post-1.0 acceptable.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** No if additive · **Automatable:** Yes

#### [EXT-18] Terminology inconsistencies (Process/Processor; Delegate/Delegated; file/type names) — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Naming/discoverability
- **Description:** `AddProcessor`/`MapProcessor` vs `IProcessRuntime`/`ProcessorContext`; `IDelegateQueryViewSource` vs `DelegatedQueryViewRegistry`; `ExecutionProcessor` lives in `ProcessExecutor.cs` (docs reference nonexistent `ExecutionProcessor.cs`). (KAL-M09, KAL-L02)
- **Recommended Fix:** Adopt a glossary pre-1.0; rename consistently; align file/type names.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Yes — renames · **Migration:** Medium · **Automatable:** Partly

#### [EXT-19] XML docs generated but CS1591 suppressed; stale XML comments — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** Documentation quality
- **Description:** `GenerateDocumentationFile` on, CS1591 suppressed globally; stale comments exist (`/queries` vs actual `/queryable` route text in `KaleidoServiceOptions`). (KAL-M12, F-20)
- **Recommended Fix:** Require XML docs on the retained public API after surface reduction; stale-cref/route checks.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No · **Automatable:** Yes

### External-only validation matrix (do not skip)

Both external reviews emphasize — correctly — that none of the three reviews executed the code. Required before 1.0 signoff: clean restore/build/test/pack, analyzer self-host proof, `.nupkg` content inspection + consumer smoke install, public-API baseline, vulnerability/secret scans + SBOM, concurrency/idempotency tests, outbox fault injection, relational-provider async/load tests, event redaction tests, authorization tests, rolling-upgrade/registry freshness tests, OTel in-memory exporter tests, benchmarks. Tracked as MP-024/Q-007 scope.

---

## Design Confirmations & Verified-Clean Areas

**Verified clean (checked, no findings):**
- Layering: `Kaleido` has no transport deps; `Kaleido.Http` thin; no circular project deps; `Http.Abstractions → Kaleido` legitimate
- Security: no secrets/connection strings; no `BinaryFormatter`/TypeNameHandling; all SQLite via EF LINQ (no raw SQL); `HttpHeaderSanitizer` applied inbound/outbound/echo; pinned central package versions
- Cancellation handling is correct in `QueryContextEngine`, `DelegatedQueryViewEngine`, `ProcessStepInvoker`, `SqliteProcessContextStore` (explicit OCE catch or `when` filter) — the *only* violation is `ProcessRuntime` (CR-007)
- No raw `InvalidOperationException` in `src/`; no empty catches; `ExecutionProcessor` saves state with `CancellationToken.None` — correct
- `AddOpenTelemetry()`/`AddKaleidoInstrumentation()` two-tier API is well-designed; static ActivitySources/Meters correct
- Test naming convention (`Method_When_Condition_Expected`) consistently followed

**Confirmed intentional:**
- Strong DI enforcement analyzers (KAL0005–0014) — keep; KAL0014 captive-dependency is high-value
- `IProcessContextStore`/`IEventPublisher`/correlation accessor/query source interfaces — earned extension points, appropriately minimal
- `HttpRegistryCache` vs `HttpClientRegistryCache<T>` — intentionally different semantics (documented in code)
- `HttpClientRegistryCache` fetch-once vs force-refresh distinction — by design; needs doc (LP-014), not removal

## AI Compatibility Assessment

### Release position

| Release form | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Public GitHub repository | **Yes** — clearly labelled experimental or preview |
| Prerelease NuGet packages | **Yes, after build/package validation from a complete checkout** |
| Stable `1.0.0` packages | **Not yet** |
| "AI-compatible" positioning | **Yes** |
| "AI-native" or "safe for autonomous agents" positioning | **Not yet** |

### The discoverability is real

Kaleido's discovery design is more substantial than a simple service catalog. The unified registry combines local and downstream Process and Queryable registrations. A discovered Process step exposes: name, version, display name, description, repeatability, input fields, data types, nullability, enums, validation constraints, dependency and availability relationships, output fields and types, and metadata and execution URLs. Queryable provides an equivalent machine-readable surface including parameters, output properties, paging limits, and query URLs. Functional tests verify dependency information, output metadata, and generated execution URLs.

That gives an AI system enough to: discover available business queries and actions; construct syntactically valid requests; understand many validation requirements before making a call; follow a process through `processId`, `requiredStep`, and `availableSteps`; inspect expected result shapes; and correlate calls across services.

The explicit `processId` model is particularly appropriate. Current tool protocols treat state handles as explicit values the model carries between calls; Kaleido already follows that pattern.

### Where Kaleido currently stops short

The metadata answers **"What operations exist, and how do I call them?"** It does not yet fully answer **"Should I call this operation, is it safe, and what happens if I retry?"** That is the most important gap before autonomous-agent use is defensible.

#### [AI-001] No behavioral safety metadata on capabilities — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** API design / AI safety
- **Description:** Step and view metadata expose structural schema but no behavioral declarations: read-only vs state-changing, destructive, idempotent, requires-confirmation, required auth scopes, expected cost or duration, data sensitivity classification, retry policy, or external system contact. `Repeatable` is not the same as idempotent — a step may legally repeat while still charging a card, submitting an authorization, or sending a message. Modern AI tool descriptions require behavioral annotations alongside schema for safe autonomous invocation.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add a `StepBehavior` / `CapabilityPolicy` annotation bag to `ProcessStepMetadata` and `QueryViewMetadata`: `ReadOnly`, `HasSideEffects`, `Destructive`, `Idempotent`, `RequiresConfirmation`, `DataClassification`, `TimeoutGuidance`, `RetryGuidance`. Emit into registry/metadata endpoints. No model-provider coupling — keep runtime neutral; adapters consume the policy bag.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Additive

#### [AI-002] No optimistic concurrency or durable idempotency on process state — **CRITICAL**

- **Severity:** Critical · **Category:** Correctness / AI safety
- **Description:** AI agents and tool hosts commonly retry after timeouts, transport failures, or ambiguous results. The current process-store contract has no optimistic concurrency token and no idempotency-key support. Two concurrent calls can plan against the same state, perform side effects, and overwrite each other; a retried call can repeat a business side effect. This is important for all clients; it is especially dangerous for probabilistic callers. Relates to EXT-01/EXT-02 and Q-007.
- **Recommended Fix:** Optimistic concurrency token on `ProcessorContext`. Idempotency-key support on every state-changing endpoint (store key + result; replay on duplicate). `IProcessContextStore` contract extension. Should be revisited as a blocker for AI-compatible positioning.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Yes

#### [AI-003] Discovery freshness is ambiguous — no TTL, ETag, or generated-at timestamp — **MEDIUM**

- **Severity:** Medium · **Category:** API design / correctness
- **Description:** The registry has no explicit TTL, ETag, generated-at timestamp, or freshness version. Partial aggregated responses return HTTP 200 with degradation in the body. An AI system cannot know whether its snapshot is current, whether services are missing, whether a discovered URL belongs to an older deployment, or when it should refresh before invoking.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `RegistryRevision` (monotonic or hash) and `GeneratedAt` to all registry and catalog responses. Add `ETag` + `Cache-Control` to registry endpoints. Partial aggregated responses should include a `DegradedServices` list.
- **Complexity:** Small · **Breaking:** Additive

#### [AI-004] Registry leaks all capabilities regardless of caller authorization — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Security / API design
- **Description:** Discovery exposes every registered capability to every caller. EXT-07 (resolved: `MapKaleido()` returns `IEndpointConventionBuilder`) makes applying auth easier, but the registry still returns all operations without filtering. MCP guidance allows the discoverable tool set to vary according to request authorization. An AI client should receive only what it is permitted to invoke — leaking all capabilities raises both security and prompt-injection surface concerns.
- **Recommended Fix:** Authorization-aware registry filtering: optional `ICapabilityFilter` contract consulted at discovery time, injected from `HttpContext` claims. Allow explicit include/exclude lists per service. Auth integration tests (401/403 on filtered capabilities).
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** Possibly
- **Status:** **MERGED into EXT-12** — the HTTP auth epic covers inbound header trust, auth-aware discovery, and fan-out auth together.

#### [AI-005] Default event payloads too expansive for AI-oriented workloads — **HIGH**

- **Severity:** High · **Category:** Privacy / security
- **Description:** EXT-04 documents that events carry full process requests/responses and full query result sets with no redaction, classification, or size cap. This is especially dangerous for AI workloads: querying personal, medical, financial, or confidential data duplicates it into an uncontrolled pipeline, expanding regulatory footprint. EXT-04 was closed as document-only for 1.0 — that decision should be revisited before AI-compatible positioning is published.
- **Recommended Fix:** Metadata-only event default + explicit opt-in payload policy, redaction hooks, payload size cap. Tests proving sensitive values never appear in default events, logs, or OTel tags.
- **Complexity:** Large · **Breaking:** Yes

#### [AI-006] No canonical AI-tool adapter layer — **LOW (post-1.0)**

- **Severity:** Low · **Category:** API design / extensibility
- **Description:** The recommended architecture is: `Kaleido runtime → canonical capability manifest → OpenAPI / MCP / other AI-tool adapters`. No such adapter or manifest contract currently exists. Queryable contexts/views map naturally to read tools; Process steps map to action tools; `processId` is the explicit state handle.
- **Recommended Fix:** Define a `CapabilityManifest` record (`CapabilityId`, `Kind`, `Name`, `Version`, `Description`, `InputSchema`, `OutputSchema`, policy bag from AI-001, `RegistryRevision`, `GeneratedAt`). Publish a `Kaleido.Adapters.Mcp` or `Kaleido.Adapters.OpenApi` package as a separate opt-in concern. Core runtime stays neutral.
- **Complexity:** Medium · **Breaking:** No (additive package)

### Practical AI adoption sequence

1. **First:** expose a small allowlisted set of read-only Queryable operations to a supervised AI client — authenticated, bounded, auditable.
2. **Second:** add the canonical capability manifest and an AI-tool adapter (AI-006).
3. **Third:** expose low-risk idempotent Process steps with explicit confirmation.
4. **Last:** permit consequential Process actions only after AI-002 (durable idempotency), AI-004 (auth-aware discovery), AI-005 (event redaction), and AI-001 (safety metadata) are resolved.

### Bottom line

The project is publicly presentable. The concept is legitimate, and its metadata-first design is unusually well suited to AI tool discovery. It should be published as an explicitly pre-1.0 framework, not as a finished stable platform.

For AI specifically, Kaleido currently provides a strong **capability-discovery substrate**. Adding safety semantics (AI-001), schema-standard adapters (AI-006), authorization-aware discovery (AI-004), freshness metadata (AI-003), and reliable retry/idempotency behavior (AI-002) could turn that substrate into a genuinely compelling agent integration layer.

## AI & Code Intelligence Compatibility — Developer Tools

> **Note on IDs:** these findings are numbered **AI-008 through AI-014** in `REVIEW_TRACKER.yaml`
> (`ai_compatibility.ai_findings`), to avoid collision with the agent-safety findings AI-001..AI-007 above.
> The original AI-001..AI-007 labels below map to AI-008..AI-014 in order.

Kaleido is designed to be **framework-like and developer-friendly**. With AI-assisted development now standard in modern workflows (Copilot, Claude, LLM agents), the framework should explicitly support code generation.

### Why This Matters

AI code generators (LLMs, copilots) are pattern-matchers learning from:
1. **Documentation** (what should I do?)
2. **Test examples** (canonical patterns)
3. **Tooling configuration** (enforce style automatically)
4. **Type signatures** (parameter semantics via XML docs)

**When these are absent or contradictory, AI generates code that:**
- Compiles but violates invariants (wrong dispatch lane → O(n) when O(1) expected)
- Violates style conventions (wrong naming → code review friction)
- Lacks error handling (missing null checks, unhandled exceptions)
- Creates security issues (bypasses DI, missing validation)

**Impact:** Teams reject AI PRs not for logic but for style/safety → AI assistance becomes friction instead of acceleration.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL: AI-008 — Dispatch Order Not Formalized by Tests

**Problem:** Dispatch order (Static → Derived → Generic lanes) is documented but not *proven* by tests. AI copilots can't verify correct lane selection → silent performance regression or logic errors.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Order documented in `src/AGENTS.md` and README (HP-002 complete)
- ❌ No theory tests proving exhaustive/deterministic order

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Add property-based tests to `tests/Kaleido.Http.Tests/Queries/DispatchOrderTests.cs`
2. Add "For AI-Assisted Development" callout to `src/Kaleido/README.md`

**Effort:** 0.5 days | **Breaking Change:** No | **Owner:** Test lead | **Status:** PENDING

---

### 🟠 HIGH: AI-009 — Missing .editorconfig Rules

**Problem:** `.editorconfig` is minimal; missing C# 12+ rules. AI generates code violating team style → review friction.

**Recommended Fix:** Expand `.editorconfig` with namespace style, naming conventions, primary constructors, sealed records. Create `.editorconfig.template`.

**Effort:** 1 day | **Breaking Change:** No | **Owner:** Architect | **Status:** PENDING

---

### 🟠 HIGH: AI-010 — XML Documentation Coverage Gaps (60–70%)

**Problem:** Public types lack comprehensive XML docs. AI copilots rely on IntelliSense → without docs, generate mismatched code.

**Recommended Fix:** Audit and complete XML docs (Tier 1: core + abstractions). Add CI gate for ≥90% coverage. Add "For AI" remarks to key types.

**Effort:** 2–3 days | **Breaking Change:** No | **Owner:** Team (distributed) | **Status:** PENDING

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: AI-011 — IQueryContextSource<T> vs. Async Confusion

**Problem:** Both sync and async interfaces public. AI doesn't know which to implement → potential deadlock or mismatch.

**Recommended Fix:** Audit usage; if sync rare, move to internal. Add analyzer KAL1012 for misuse.

**Effort:** 1.5 days | **Breaking Change:** Possibly | **Owner:** Architect | **Status:** PENDING

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: AI-012 — Correlation Context Invariants Undocumented

**Problem:** Invariant (exactly one ID per request, echo or generate, propagate) not formally documented. AI generates code that overwrites, forgets propagation, or creates multiples.

**Recommended Fix:** Add "Correlation Context Invariants" section to `src/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Add KAL1013 analyzer proposal.

**Effort:** 0.5 days | **Breaking Change:** No | **Owner:** Architect | **Status:** PENDING

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: AI-013 — Missing Canonical Patterns

**Problem:** Test suite has patterns, but no single source of truth. AI generates plausible-but-wrong code.

**Recommended Fix:** Create `docs/PATTERNS.md` with canonical examples. Update extension points table. Add "For Code Generators" to AGENTS.md.

**Effort:** 1.5 days | **Breaking Change:** No | **Owner:** Tech lead | **Status:** PENDING

---

### 🔵 LOW: AI-014 — Security & Constraint Validation Rules Undocumented

**Problem:** Analyzers (KAL0005–KAL0014) enforce DI/constraint rules. AI doesn't know them → generates code bypassing DI.

**Recommended Fix:** Expand `docs/ANALYZERS.md` with "Security-Relevant Analyzers" table. Add quick-fix providers.

**Effort:** 1 day | **Breaking Change:** No | **Owner:** Security / Architect | **Status:** PENDING

1. **Fix the docs** — purge `Kaleido.AspNetCore` from README/ARCHITECTURE; make the quickstart compile (CR-004)
2. **Rename `UseSqliteContextStore` → `UseSqliteProcessContextStore`** — matches docs + runtime warning (HP-005)
3. **Fix `ExceptionMiddleware` mapping** — `BadHttpRequestException` → 400 (HP-007)
4. **Remove duplicate `Canceled()` in `ProcessRuntime`** + add OCE invariant tests (CR-007)

### Top 10 Simplification Opportunities

1. Collapse `ProcessStepRegistry` 4-pass pipeline (MP-018)
2. Delete `GuardQueryAsync` → middleware owns 400s (MP-007)
3. Consolidate `FieldLookup`×3 + metadata builders (MP-020)
4. `ProcessResponseFactory` → internal statics (MP-013)
5. Explicit marker instead of options-sniffing in `MapRegistry`/`AddHttp` (MP-008, LP-012)
6. Flatten `RepeatableOptions`; drop `EmptyQueryViewParameters` need (MP-021)
7. Internalize public implementations + SQLite surface (MP-016)
8. Consolidate endpoint-name constants policy (LP-009)
9. Cache hot-path reflection (MP-009)
10. Retire or adopt `SutFixture` — end the half-state (MP-017)

### Top 10 Code-Deletion Opportunities

1. `src/Core/` + `src/Kaleido.AspNetCore/` stale bin/obj trees (MP-022)
2. `GuardQueryAsync` + `ValidationErrorResult` (MP-007)
3. `catch (OCE)` in `ProcessRuntime` (CR-007)
4. `QueryContextRegistry.GetAll()`/`QueryViewRegistry.GetAll()` (LP-015)
5. `ICorrelationHeaderStamper.Sanitize`, `CorrelationAccessor` base member (LP-015)
6. Empty/stub test files + `Kaleido.Analyzers.UnitTests` project (MP-019, MP-017)
7. Commented `FilterOperator` members (LP-009)
8. `kaleido-context.xml`, `cleanup *.md` root artifacts (MP-022)
9. `TypeDefinition/Definition/Node/Slot` intermediate records (MP-018)
10. Redundant package references (LP-005)

### Biggest Concerns

- **Architectural:** boundary leaks (`KaleidoClientOptions` in core, `ProcessResponseFactory` in contracts, `KaleidoHttpTelemetry` coupling) — small now, permanent after 1.0
- **Maintainability:** `ExecutionProcessorTests` brittleness + `ProcessStepRegistry` over-materialization
- **Consumer experience:** a quickstart that doesn't compile, plus silent-loss defaults (events, state)
- **Documentation:** root architecture doc describes a deleted project; several documented APIs don't exist
- **Release risk:** shipping the published contract surface (error mapping, endpoint names, correlation headers) with near-zero contract tests

### Scores (explained)

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Architecture | 8/10 | Verified layering; two real but small boundary leaks; clean provider pattern |
| Simplicity | 6/10 | Registry/metadata machinery heavier than the problem demands; shadowed contracts |
| Developer Experience | 5/10 | Non-compiling quickstart; magic defaults; hidden ServiceName contract |
| API Design | 6/10 | Mostly honest surface; typo'd const, internal-only programmatic APIs, fragile conventions |
| Maintainability | 6/10 | Duplication blocks + brittle mega-test-file; good conventions elsewhere |
| Testability | 4/10 | Strong harness investment (SutFixture, analyzers) but published contracts untested; empty test files |
| Observability | 7/10 | Thoughtful signal design; one invariant violation + minor inconsistencies |
| Documentation | 4/10 | Good contributor docs; root/consumer docs describe deleted APIs |
| Release Readiness | 5/10 | Fix docs + contract tests + two status/API bugs; then ready |

## Recommended Actions

### Recommended Release Blockers (must fix before 1.0)

- CR-004 (docs describe removed project; quickstart broken)
- CR-005, CR-006 (published-contract tests: error mapping, correlation echo)
- CR-007 (cancellation invariant violation + tests)
- HP-005 (SQLite method rename), HP-007 (500→400), HP-015 (endpoint-name typo)
- HP-009 (document/enforce unsafe defaults — at minimum document + fix wrong warning text)
- HP-010 (Moq/SQLitePCLRaw), CR-003 (versioning)
- **External-merge blockers:**
  - EXT-01 (process store concurrency/CAS + idempotency) — needs a design decision even if implementation is scoped
  - EXT-02 (atomic state/event commit or explicit contract) — design decision required
  - EXT-03 (sync I/O behind async query APIs — verified defect)
  - EXT-04 (event payload privacy policy — at minimum metadata-only default)
  - EXT-05 (empty packable `Kaleido.Analyzers` — delete or package correctly)
  - EXT-07 (`Map*` authorization composition — decide convention-builder return)
  - Validation evidence matrix (external reviews): clean build/test/pack + scans must run before signoff

### Recommended Pre-1.0 Improvements

- HP-006, HP-008, HP-011–HP-014, HP-016–HP-018
- MP-005–MP-016, MP-019 (test gaps), MP-020–MP-026
- Analyzer proposals KAL0020/KAL0021 (internal, cheap)

### Recommended Post-1.0 Improvements

- MP-001 (feature-based organization), MP-017 remainder, MP-018 (if `ProcessStepDependencyGraph` ships)
- LP-001–LP-015, LP-011 (OpenAPI), KAL2001–2004 (consumer analyzer package)
- Multi-transport question (Q-001) — informed by whether the boundary leaks are plugged

### Open Questions (updated)

| ID | Question | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| Q-001 | Non-HTTP transports in the future? (Informs how far to take boundary fixes) | Open |
| Q-002 | Real-world `IEventPublisher` consumers? (If none, HP-009 enforcement is easier) | Open |
| Q-003 | Is `MapRegistry` always-200 contract deliberate? (MP-026) | Open |
| Q-004 | Should `SutFixture` be adopted broadly or retired? (MP-017) | Open |
| Q-005 | Should `Assemblies` fallback be removed entirely? (HP-012) | Open |
| Q-006 | Analyzer disposition table: keep DI-hygiene suite (v2) vs prune to correctness-only rules (external)? (MP-017) | Open |
| Q-007 | Scope of EXT-01/EXT-02 for 1.0: full CAS+outbox vs contract-design-now/implement-later? | Open — biggest decision |
| Q-008 | Ship a consumer analyzer package (KAL2xxx) or repo-only tooling? (EXT-05) | Open |
